### Week 3
Linear Regression
The goal of this assignment is to study and implement simple linear regression using three different approaches:
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method
- SKLearn library
- Gradient Descent
Select a real dataset from UCI machine  Learning Repository with one dependent variable and one independent variable to compare the results of each approach and respond to the following questions.
Discuss the full story of the dataset and discuss why regression is applicable on the dataset.
- Write a code to show 
- How many total observations in data?
- Data Distribution of independent and independent variables?
- Relationship between dependent and independent variables(Correlation analysis).
- Write a code to implement linear regression using the Ordinary Least Squares method on selected dataset. 
- Use sklearn API to create linear regression using selected dataset. Print intercept and slope of a model. 
- Write a code to implement linear regression using Gradient Descent from scratch on selected dataset. 
- Quantify the goodness of your model using a table to display the result of predictions using SSE, RMSE and R2Score and discuss interpretation of errors and  steps taken for improvement of errors.
